<h2>$department.name Department Wiki</h2>

<p>Just like any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">Wiki</a>, you can
create new pages under <tt>/department/$department.abbreviation/wiki/content/</tt>,
e.g. <tt>/department/$department.abbreviation/wiki/content/mypage</tt>, or
<tt>/department/$department.abbreviation/wiki/content/some/path/to/mypage</tt>.
Simply go to the URL where the page is supposed to be, and if the page does not
exist, you will be given the choice to create it. Note that you must log onto
CSNS before you can create any page.</p>
